## Harvard CSCI E-12 Final Project

This is my final project for the Spring 2015 CSCI E-12 website development graduate class. It's a minimalist drawing app that lets you sketch a design in the browser using the HTML5 \<canvas\> element, then save the sketch as a PNG image file. I built the app using a LAMP stack: the client side uses Zurb Foundation 5, Handlebars.js, and jQuery, with PHP 5.4 on an Apache server.
