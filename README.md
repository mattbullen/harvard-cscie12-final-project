# Harvard CSCI E-12 Final Project

This is my final project for Harvard's CSCI E-12 website development class, Spring 2015 semester. It's a minimalist drawing app - sketch something in the browser, then save the finished sketch as a PNG. The client side uses HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript, with PHP 5.4 on the server.
