# Harvard CSCI E-12 Final Project

This is my final project for Harvard's CSCI E-12 website development class, Spring 2015 semester. It's a minimalist drawing app that lets you sketch something in the browser using the HTML5 <canvas> element, then save the sketch as a PNG image file. I built the app using a LAMP stack: the client side uses HTML5 + CSS3 + jQuery + custom JavaScript, with PHP 5.4 on an Apache server.
